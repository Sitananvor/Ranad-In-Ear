# Ranad-In-Ear
A sound-damping pad for the ranad ek that reduces strike sounds, allowing the player to hear the notes through headphones. This helps reduce background noise and minimizes disturbances from others practicing different Thai musical instruments. It enables the player to focus better on practice and prevents missing notes during rehearsal.
